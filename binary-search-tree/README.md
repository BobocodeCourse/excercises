# Binary Search Tree with TDD - 2 in 1

 ### - improve *Java* skills implementing BST 
 ### - practice with *TDD* discipline
 
**Binary Search Tree (BST)** is an ordered (sorted) binary tree. You job is to implement the interface `BinarySearchTree`
 as it is done in `BinarySearchTreeImpl.java`. The first part of the exercise:
 1. Drop implementation, and create an empty one. Implement methods until you have all tests passed
 2. Drop implementation and tests. Implement `BinarySearchTree` using TDD discipline
